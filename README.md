I used pin 2 instead of 9, both will provide you with the same output.

Connect the LED light with the Arduino Board at pin 13. Longer pin of LED is positive and Shorter pin is negative.

After downloading , open the Arduino IDE. Go to **Tools -> Boards -> Boards Manager**. In Boards Manager search for **Arduino AVR Boards**. Download
the latest version of Arduino AVR Boards(I used 1.8.6).
